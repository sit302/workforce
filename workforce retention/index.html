				<h3>Online Exit Interviews</h3>
				<p>
					Online exit interviews can offer powerful insight into why your employees are leaving. Effective exit interview programs are often difficult for organisations to run in-house because the exit information is not collected consistently and reported objectively. The exiting employee is also less likely to tell the truth about why they are leaving unless the interview is confidential. Outsourcing your exit interview program to Workforce Retention not only saves time and cost but the on-line exit reporting provides powerful information on employee sentiment not just on what went wrong, but also what went right!
					
					Benefits of Outsourcing to Workforce Retention
					
					Exiting staff divulge relevant information with our tools. The information is candid and data more valid.
					Participation rates are high compared with other exit programs.
					The interview structure and reporting tool provides insight on the top reasons for leaving quickly and effectively.  
					All interview data is captured centrally and analysed objectively. The web tool enables managers to gain insight straight from their desktop 24/7. 
					The tool enables you to choose whether the process is confidential or non-confidential.  Non-confidential means the individual’s exit interview can be viewed by the manager.
					Participants are very happy with Workforce Retentions process and have a willingness to provide candid feedback about their experience. 
					How Is It Done?
					
					We go through an exit interview customisation process with you to ensure the data captured is completely relevant to your organisaiton.
					The exiting employee receives an email and link to their own online interview. Whilst they answer questions and input information the data is captured and indexed in the web hosted database.
					You and other appointed management can logon to your website account at any stage in the program and view reported results from the quantitative interview responses.
					A comprehensive quarterly exit report is also available in your account with drill down analysis on hot spots in the organisation and highlighting the themes and trends from quantitative and qualitative analysis. This quarterly exit report is posted to your web site account and also presented in person to the HR/ Management team.
					What is the cost?
					
					Prices start from $3,000 AUD per annum for self administer. A comprehensive list of pricing is available on request. For more information contact Angeline Wilkes</p>

				<h3>Phone Exit Interviews</h3>
				<p>Workforce Retention's Exit Interview Program has specialised staff sensitively collect information from exiting employees via a phone exit interview. Participating organisations can view automated exit reports through a web-hosted database at any stage in the program. At the culimiation of the program cycle (three months) a comprehsive exit report is accessed by managment providing them with insightful information about the root causes of employee turnover, where employee turnover is manifesting and why.

					Cost of Employee Turnover
					
					Well-documented costs associated with losing good employees range from 1–2.5 times their salary. (Australian Institute of Management, Saratoga Institute)
					A reduction of 5%, for a medium-sized company experiencing unhealthy turnover, could save approximately $5,000,000 p.a.  (based on: company size: 2000 employees; turnover rate of 22%; costing 1xaverage salary $50,000)
					Hidden consequences include losses in productivity, intellectual capital, training dollars, lost business and reduced morale.
					How Is It Done
					
					We review the interview structure with you and agree on any necessary adjustments so that the data captured will be relevant to your organisation.
					We work with your HR staff to obtain names and contact information on your exiting or former employees.
					We conduct an comprehensive probing interview with each former employee, maintain quantitative data and qualitative information in our web-hosted database.
					Management can logon to their website client account at any stage in the program and view reported results from the quantitative interview responses.
					The data is compiled and comprehensively analysed to uncover specific patterns and trends. A drill-down analysis is also provided for deeper insight into where turnover is manifesting and why.
					A quarterly exit report is posted to the web-site and accessed via a secure logon and presented to the HR/ Management team.
					Limitations with Internal Exit Interview Programs:
					
					HR are often more focused on other initiatives and running exit interviews is not seen as a core part of their role. Internal exit interview programs are notoriously unreliable, particularly when conducted by someone who may later be asked to provide a reference. When the internal exit interview programs develop a reputation for not creating positive change the departing employee does not engage in the process, believing  their information will be filed and forgotten. These factors translate to wasted time, energy and money. They do actual damage to the employer brand.
					
					Why Outsource?
					
					Advantages of outsourcing your exit interview program include:
					
					A third party provides an impartial process so that exiting staff are more willing to divulge relevant information.
					No fear of retribution
					The environment is non-threatening
					A dedicated resource manages the entire process. Information is collected centrally and analysed objectively so the organisation can make meaningful impact.
					The participant is assured of complete anonymity as their information will contribute towards an overall assessment for the organisation. This encourages even greater candour.
					The psychology in leaving the participant with a sense of having contributed to something worthwhile adds to a continued rapport and positive image of the company.</p>
